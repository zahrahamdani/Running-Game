# Running-Game
We designed a videogame using C++, which is the industry standard for developing games. While most modern game engines (2d and 3d) are written in that language, our 2d game was built using the SFML library. It stands for Simple and Fast Multimedia Library. It is an efficient and easy way to use C++ and develop graphic applications.
